Javascript Interview Test
=========================

Setup
-----

Open `main.html` in a Chrome browser window.

Problems
--------

- Every 1 second, change the color of the ball to a random color.
done
- Make the game updates frame rate independent.
done(?)
- Add a second ball of a different type of ball to the game.  This "fast" ball
  moves at twice the speed of the "normal" ball, and the twice the size.
  How would you extend this additional 
  types of objects in the game?  I.e.: if we had 10 different types of balls.  What code would you restructure to do this?
 done
- Allow for any number of additional balls (of either "normal" or "fast" type) in the game.  Allow to set `N` "normal" balls
  and `M` "fast" balls via a variable, so we can try different amounts of both.

  - awaits
  
- Add a score to the game.
done

- Allow the game to be paused.
done
- Allow the game to be scaled according to the browser size.  
done
- Allow the game to be rotated from a portrait orientation ("balls bounce left to
  right") to a landscape orientation ("ball bounces top to bottom")
